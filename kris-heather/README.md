## Overview
This is a blog app that allows the user to filter the blogs by author or category. The blog also shows previews of each post and the user can read more or less by clicking the provided option.

## Problem Domain
- As a user, I want to be able to filter my articles so that I can selectively view articles by author or by category.

- As a user, I want tab-based navigation so that I can easily visit other sections of my site.

- As a developer, I want my code to be thoughtfully organized, easy to read, and executing efficiently.

## Getting Started
